# Spavento 

Spavento fell from the sky in smoke and fire, his ears ringing.

For three years he had been carried, as a conscript, on one of the empire's largest citadels, over the Balearic and Tyrrhenian sea, to join forces with the mercenaries and zealots loyal to the Spanish crown, plowing north into the papal territories, sowing them with blood and terror.

He went from a farm boy, staring wide eyed at the wonders of the world beyond the hills where he tended goats and chased amorous maidens, to a scarred and scouring veteran, grizzled beard covering his dark face almost up to his haunted eyes, matted hair pushed under his dented and blood-stained helmet. Barely twenty years old, his muscles were hardened from lifting the ballast ropes and sails, his spirit blasted from military drills and horror.

Spavento was, in a way, already becoming the comic mask of the Captain, the soldier who hid his cowardice behind impossible boasts and braggadocio. His moral failure, though, his consuming hatred of himself to be expressed in slap-stick violence and misogyny, didn't come from running away from battle, but by being carried into it, turned into an instrument of death and mutilation, without finding the courage to throw himself from the flying island spewing cannon smoke and blades.

When he did fall, then, after locking eyes with the ascensionist whose ankles, had he not hesitated, he could have dagger-sliced, he didn't feel fear, but relief. He wouldn't be forced to kill again, to know the thoughts and feel the pain of the men whose flesh he cut and mangled.

I want this novel to feel like a doll house the moment when the real house is exploding, a last suspension of disbelief before the illusion of reversed gravity is just a comic turning of perspective.


<!--In earlier imaginings, the Lieutenant was pointing a gun at them, trying to decide if he should shoot. I like the meta flavor of the outranking officer pretending to read a document in Italian.-->

The grizzled face of the Lieutenant as he looked up and down between the papers and the Harlequin, Dottore, and Capitano, who were in reality the acrobat, the wine merchant, and the mercenary. 

I'm skipping ahead a bit in the story, past the drunken fisticuffs between the doctor and the captain, and the long days of mute mimicry. If we are to trace the performances of the *comici* back to a particular impulse, a practice, those heedless days of near-telepathic pantomime set the tone of everything to come: they were just clowning, a kind of desperate dancing at what they assumed was the absolute end, which turned out to be immediately useful to their survival.

The Lieutenant, from the actors point of view, wasn't literally menacing them with the flint-lock at his waist, but had all the power of the theocracy behind him, to not only take away everything in their lives that might still have value but to dunk their remaining days in a mire of unending and unwitnessed misery.
