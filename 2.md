# 2: Mask of the Archbishop



<!--In earlier imaginings, the archbishop was pointing a gun at them, trying to decide if he should shoot. I like the meta flavor of the outranking officer pretending to read a document in Italian.-->

The grizzled face of the archbishop looked back and forth between the forged papers and the acrobat, wine merchant, and dragoon. 

I'm skipping ahead a bit in the story, past the drunken fisticuffs between the doctor and the captain, and the long days of mute mimicry. If we are to trace the performances of the *comici* back to a particular impulse, a practice, those heedless near-telepathic pantomimes set the tone of everything to come: they were clowning, a kind of desperate dancing at what they assumed was the absolute end, which turned out to be immediately useful to their survival.

The archbishop, from their point of view, wasn't literally menacing them with the flint-lock at his waist, but had the full power of the theocracy behind him, to take away everything in their lives that might still have value, and dunk their remaining days in a mire of unending and unwitnessed misery.

The Harlequin, though, noticed something about the uniform, which curled and laced a little too eloquently not to be a costume, pious and misdirected vanities aside. She could tell by his posture, the length of eye contact, that he was faking it. He couldn't read, any more than the captain could. 

There was, for a moment, a slipping of the mask, in involuntary winking. Unlike with Spavento, Lucrezia, and Graziano, there was no telepathic flash of bonding, which would allow my narrative omniscience to extend to him as well, but the Harlequin was so good at seeing through disguises, and reading people's characters, that she *might as well* have been able to see into his mind. Every appearance and reason told her that the archbishop was their mortal enemy, yet somehow, beneath his studied sternness, he radiated warmth, and the acrobat was sure he was on their side, in a spiritual sense.
 
The gravitas was undermined by the braying of a donkey, and the smell of horse manure from the stables. The dying vineyards behind them luminesced like fireflies, and the horizon was molten with battlefields. 

"You saw the part about the pigeons?" Lucrezia asked him, deferentially. 

"Mmm, yes," the archbishop said. "Very good." There was nothing in the papers about pigeons. It was, in fact, an old playbill that they had sealed with wax, with official looking lettering.

A long pause later, and he said, without a hint of a smile, "The earthworms, too, and grasshoppers."

Her heart beat faster, and she slowed it down. "Only every third row," she said lightly, and then wondered if she had gone too far. The illiterate archbishop's expression gave away nothing. Who was he, really?

The bedraggled prisoners were what confused her. Their Spanish uniforms no more than muddy rags, their unsoled boots gaping over mangled or gangrenous toes. "Your captives will stay here?" Lucrezia asked, interrupting the Dottore, who was explaining the varietals of ascended grapes his family had cultivated, how wine from floating vineyards had a particular *terroir*.

They had all already been given as much bread dipped in watery stew as they could stomach, wooden bowls stacked like a pagoda, waiting to be taken to water and washed. Even though there might be bodies rotting upstream. 

There was no way that the Spaniards could have faked their abject deference and hunger. One of them might have been a good enough actor to fool her, but not all eight. Their ankles were unbound, and the rawhide straps on their wrists were loose and worn enough to be considered more symbols than any form of functional restraint.

As much as acrobatics had been part of her formal training as a itinerant mummer, so to had been understanding the petty hierarchies and grievances of the power brokers lording over the countryside or village, be they clerical, martial, or just some local loudmouth who held disproportionate sway, but might secretly be hated. The rain-soaked prisoners *believed* the archbishop was who he said he was, and his power over them was legitimate. She, within minutes of hearing his voice, despite him speaking primarily in monosyllables, knew otherwise. Lecrezia recognized his costume, and knew where it came from.

"Yes," the archbishop said. "Show me the cellars."
