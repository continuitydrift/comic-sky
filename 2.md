<!--In earlier imaginings, the Lieutenant was pointing a gun at them, trying to decide if he should shoot. I like the meta flavor of the outranking officer pretending to read a document in Italian.-->

The grizzled face of the Lieutenant as he looked up and down between the papers and the Harlequin, Dottore, and Capitano, who were in reality the acrobat, the wine merchant, and the mercenary. 

I'm skipping ahead a bit in the story, past the drunken fisticuffs between the doctor and the captain, and the long days of mute mimicry. If we are to trace the performances of the *comici* back to a particular impulse, a practice, those heedless days of near-telepathic pantomime set the tone of everything to come: they were just clowning, a kind of desperate dancing at what they assumed was the absolute end, which turned out to be immediately useful to their survival.

The Lieutenant, from the actors point of view, wasn't literally menacing them with the flint-lock at his waist, but had all the power of the theocracy behind him, to not only take away everything in their lives that might still have value but to dunk their remaining days in a mire of unending and witnessed misery.

The Harlequin, though, noticed something about the uniform, which curled and laced a little too eloquently not to be a costume, pious and misdirected vanities aside. She could tell by his posture, the length of eye contact, that he was faking it. He couldn't read italian any more than the captain could.
