1: The Origins of the Infamous Commedians

# ~ Dottore 

The general squinted down his piece-nez as if sighting down a barrel, deciding if the shot was worth the ammunition. 

The courtyard had the hybrid pageantry of both market and occupation, sellers hawking wares and sergeants barking orders. 

He had barely glanced at their proferred permits, which the young Dottore had forged the night before. 

<!-- So sure, a deviation from the plan. -->

That was a week after the Capitano fell from the sky, after the Harlequin had dragged them through a desperate boot-camp of her father's techniques.

Spavento fell from the sky in smoke and fire, his ears ringing.

For three years he had been carried, as a conscript, on one of the empire's largest citadels, over the Balearic and Tyrrhenian sea, to join forces with the mercenaries and zealots loyal to the Spanish crown, plowing north into the papal territories, sowing them with blood and terror.

He went from a farm boy, staring wide eyed at the wonders of the world beyond the hills where he tended goats and chased amorous maidens, to a scarred and scouring veteran, grizzled beard covering his dark face almost up to his haunted eyes, matted hair pushed under his dented and blood-stained helmet. Barely twenty years old, his muscles were hardened from lifting the ballast ropes and sails, his spirit blasted from military drills and horror.

Spavento was, in a way, already becoming the comic mask of the Captain, the  soldier who hid his cowardice behind impossible boasts and braggadocio. His moral failure, though, his consuming hatred of himself to be expressed in slap-stick violence and misogyny, didn't come from running away from battle, but by being carried into it, turned into an instrument of death and mutilation, without finding the courage to throw himself from the flying island spewing cannon smoke and blades.

When he did fall, then, after locking eyes with the ascensionist whose ankles, had he not hesitated, he could have dagger-sliced, he didn't feel fear, but relief. He wouldn't be forced to kill again, to know the thoughts and feel the pain of the men whose flesh he cut and mangled.
