1: The Origins of the Infamous Comedians

# ~ Dottore 

The general squinted down his piece-nez as if sighting down a barrel, deciding if the shot was worth the ammunition. 

The courtyard had the hybrid pageantry of both market and occupation, sellers hawking wares and sergeants barking orders. 

He had barely glanced at their proferred permits, which the young Dottore had forged the night before.

That was a week after the Capitano fell from the sky, after the Harlequin had dragged them through a desperate boot-camp of her father's techniques.

There is some debate about what the greatest performance of the Comici Malfamati was. At the floating palace of Versaille, or the other, larger, much stranger performance. One thing the author of this text believes, and would like to come through, is that art, theatrical, musical, or novelistic, is useful. Rather than evalauting a performance on some kind of arbitrary, objective, or formal scale, one can evaluate

This could be the cover of the novel. Take whatever image you might have of a quaint vinyarded villa, gnarled old olive and fig trees, fountained pools stocked with rust-colored fish.  <!--too many adjectives-->Lift it, gently, from the ground, allowing the concave bowls of uprooted stony soil, to moulder and erode for a few thousand years, fuzzing over with moss and flowers.

You can imagine feeding such a description into an AI generator. Just think, the image in a reader's mind, imagining an algorithmic rendering of the above paragraph, couldn't have existed a year ago, and to the reader a year from now, the picture they would have of a "robot" mind's picturing the scene is unimaginable to us.

Now, frame everything with the facade of the old manor house, the wall ripped out. In order to get the destruction right, the architectural shearing away of sections like a cubist's foreshortening, you would have to know, or sense, how a villa, with its attached outbuildings, had been constructed with some combinaton of living and dead *apergetic*, or anti-gravitational wood. To be precise, the local reversal of  is some combination of fungus and algae that doesn't exist in your reality. It can live symbiotically in trees or unsustainably in the wood after lumbering and carving, the bouyancy period extended through trade secrets trapped in laquer. 

Everything was canted, collapsing, or on fire, the sky striated with skeins of black smoke. Trellised rotundas, gazebos, gondolas, all the networked bridges and gardens lay dead like ships at the bottom of the sea. The main hall itself was expected to touch the earth at any moment, for the first time centuries. The battle line had swept over the ancient villa, and the small village of Torn to which it was attached, finishing off the damage that garrising the Papal regiments, their engineers having stripped the vinyards of all the anti-gravitational flora and fauna that could be fed into their flying engines of war.

The proprietor of the villa, the future Dottore, is standing by a grand piano. The Harlequin has come in and is standing unnoticed by the bookshelf, still holding the playbook with the *lazzi*. She is tearing the pages out, one by one. The page that says *The Harlequin leaps onto the stage* flutters by his ear at the precise moment the bottom-most point of the main villa crunched into nest of dead grape vines and salted soil, sending both of them flying towards the open, broken, wall and window.


# Spavento 

Spavento fell from the sky in smoke and fire, his ears ringing.

For three years he had been carried, as a conscript, on one of the empire's largest citadels, over the Balearic and Tyrrhenian sea, to join forces with the mercenaries and zealots loyal to the Spanish crown, plowing north into the papal territories, sowing them with blood and terror.

He went from a farm boy, staring wide eyed at the wonders of the world beyond the hills where he tended goats and chased amorous maidens, to a scarred and scouring veteran, grizzled beard covering his dark face almost up to his haunted eyes, matted hair pushed under his dented and blood-stained helmet. Barely twenty years old, his muscles were hardened from lifting the ballast ropes and sails, his spirit blasted from military drills and horror.

Spavento was, in a way, already becoming the comic mask of the Captain, the  soldier who hid his cowardice behind impossible boasts and braggadocio. His moral failure, though, his consuming hatred of himself to be expressed in slap-stick violence and misogyny, didn't come from running away from battle, but by being carried into it, turned into an instrument of death and mutilation, without finding the courage to throw himself from the flying island spewing cannon smoke and blades.

When he did fall, then, after locking eyes with the ascensionist whose ankles, had he not hesitated, he could have dagger-sliced, he didn't feel fear, but relief. He wouldn't be forced to kill again, to know the thoughts and feel the pain of the men whose flesh he cut and mangled.
