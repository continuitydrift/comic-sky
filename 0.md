*The Harlequin leaps onto the stage*

# ~ Harlequin

<!-- out of the fourth wall, the vining clods of scorched and wasted earth. -->

As if the stage direction had killed him. Those words, for Lucrezia, spelled disaster, death. Yet also, all of the other times her father had jumped onto the stage, excepting the last.

<!-- Or the prologue could be something different, and this the start of the first chapter. -->

Lucrezia's head hung upside down, her shoulders just off the edge of the unmade bed, looking from the torn and tattered playbook to the tapestry floating on the inverted wall.

Blood rushed to her head, but she adjusted her breathing and heart rate, drawing on her training as an acrobat. To make sense of images while they were falling, or you were. To sense the dense fabrics of interlocking perspecrtives.

Gravity told her that down was the direction contra-indicated by her eyes, in the same way that the elation of her freedom from financial and social contracts was giving her signals in defiance of the pressing fear about ruin, destitution, and violence.

The Harlequin's daughter looked again at the playbook, the script-less arguments, and felt the pull of all those algorithmic engine's, like the Baroness's ingenious stage machinery. She turned it upside down, which was rightside up from the perspective of the once-opulent room, dark wood crouching under dusty stains and varnish.

Here was the recent history depicted in the tapestry: The Papal States made several ill-considered concessions to Spanish aggressors, the actual conflict in the northen peninsula a scaled-down proxy for larger military tensions stretched taught across Europe. Huge citadels, war machines of flying vines and steel, scorched terror onto farms and villages, and petty nobles had to choose sides in quickly changing games, the stakes of which were death, or at least those of there surplus peasantry and mercenary forces.

Her training, her knowledge, the grudging respect she'd earned from the other comedians, all of it was now as meaningless as coin minted by a foreign power. The great show would never happen. The world in which it was possible had ended. There was nothing left but flight, terror and depradation.

What would it mean to have the greatest performance ever?

<!-- This draft of the novel should be preoccupied with the dynamics of a society or company, trying to create something beautiful together. -->

It was a preoccupation of both her and her father. The whole troupe, the subject of many heated and boozy arguments, lit by greasy candles. They would start as their stage coach, the mud-warped axels turning the wheels against each other, trundled out of some swampy town, go silent for half a day, and pick it up again as they rolled into the next weed-conquered fairground where they would set up camp, ready to tumble and sing for the next morning's breakfast.

She remembered Jaques, their Scapin, reclining dangerously in the little crow's nest he tied with his acrobat's nets, patched trousers jouncing with the holes in the road, declaiming, "the greatest performance ever would have to outshine the ancestors. It would be calling bad luck on ourselves."

"To say nothing of the dreariness of life afterward, knowing there would be nothing left that could compare" her mother had put in, riding backwards on the Dray, leaning against her father, the brim of his hat shading them both.

"You wouldn't know it was the greatest performance," her famous father said, the one among them that had risen closest to greatness. "Not at the time. Maybe not ever."

She kicked her legs over her head, off the bed, with an acrobatic clip of bodyweight.

From the moment of the kick-flip, the momentum of the thing was set. The next Harlequin had leapt onto the stage.

This could be the cover of the novel. Take whatever image you might have of a quaint vinyarded villa, gnarled old olive and fig trees, fountained pools stocked with rust-colored fish.  <!--too many adjectives-->Lift it, gently, from the ground, allowing the concave bowls of uprooted stony soil, to moulder and erode for a few thousand years, fuzzing over with moss and flowers. 

<!--
You can imagine feeding such a description into an AI generator. Just think, the image in a reader's mind, imagining an algorithmic rendering of the above paragraph, couldn't have existed a year ago, and to the reader a year from now, the picture they would have of a "robot" mind's picturing the scene is unimaginable to us.
-->

Now, frame everything with the facade of the old manor house, the wall ripped out. In order to get the destruction right, the architectural shearing away of sections like a cubist's foreshortening, you would have to know, or sense, how a villa, with its attached outbuildings, had been constructed with some combinaton of living and dead *apergetic*, or anti-gravitational wood. To be precise, it is some combination of fungus and algae that doesn't exist in your reality. It can live symbiotically in trees or unsustainably in the wood after lumbering and carving, the bouyancy period extended through trade secrets trapped in laquer.
