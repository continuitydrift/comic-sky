<!-- out of the fourth wall, the vining clods of scorched and wasted earth. -->

As if the stage direction had killed him. Those words, for Lucrezia, spelled disaster, death. Yet also, all of the other times her father had jumped onto the stage, excepting the last.

<!-- Or the prologue could be something different, and this the start of the first chapter. -->

Lucrezia's head hung upside down, her shoulders just off the edge of the unmade bed, looking from the torn and tattered playbook to the tapestry floating on the inverted wall.

Blood rushed to her head, but she adjusted her breathing and heart rate, drawing unconsciously on her training as an acrobat. To make sense of images while they were falling, or you were. To sense the dense fabrics of interlocking perspecrtives.

Gravity told her that down was the direction contra-indicated by her eyes, in the same way that the elation of her freedom from financial and social contracts was giving her signals in defiance of the pressing fear about ruin, destitution, and violence.

The Harlequin's daughter looked again at the playbook, the script-less arguments, and felt the pull of all those algorithmic engine's, like the Baroness's ingenious stage machinery. She turned it upside down, which was rightside up from the perspective of the once-opulent room, varnish covering dust.

Here was the recent history depicted in the tapestry: The Papal States made several ill-considered concessions to Spanish aggressors, the actual conflict in the northen peninsula a scaled-down proxy for the military tensions stretched taught across 17th century Europe. Huge citadels, war machines of flying vines and steel, scorched terror onto farms and villages, and petty nobles had to choose sides in quickly changing games, the stakes of which were death, or at least those of there surplus peasantry and mercenary forces.

Her training, her knowledge, the grudging respect she'd earned from the other comedians, all of it was as meaningless as coin minted by a foreign power. 

She kicked her legs over her head, off the bed, with an acrobatic clip of bodyweight. The acrobat didn't know what to do. 


From the moment of the kick-flip, the momentum of the thing was set. The next Harlequin had leapt onto the stage.
