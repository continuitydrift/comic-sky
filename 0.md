# Prologue: Harlequin Torn

<!-- argument. 
Lucrezia lies in bed and looks at an upside down tapestry. Kicks herself backwards off the bed.

*The Harlequin leaps onto the stage*

<!-- out of the fourth wall, the vining clods of scorched and wasted earth. -->

Those words, for Lucrezia, spelled disaster, death. As if the direction itself had killed him, misdirecting her famous father with a rug-pulled promise of landing on the boards.<!--The ultimate diagram, or instruction. The fatal chord of notes, where to hear it, or read it, was to die. -->Yet also, those ink-faded words evoked all of the other times her father had jumped safely from landings to the stage, excepting the last. The sudden explosion of both blood and possibilities.

<!-- Or the prologue could be something different, and this the start of the first chapter.  It has to work as a book end, not just for this novel, but for the series. So continuity and drift should be balanced.-->

Lucrezia's head hung upside down, her shoulders off the edge of the unmade bed, looking from the torn and tattered playbook to the tapestry floating on the inverted wall. 

Oxygenated blood rushed to her head, but she adjusted her breathing and heart rate, drawing on her training as an acrobat. To parse patterns of images while they were falling, or you were. To sense dense interlocking perspectives.

These sorts of exercises, intentionally jolting focus from words on a page to a moving, attention-demanding background, were instinctual. The continual training, honing, and improvement of the needed skills was also autonomic. Now, some deep part of the Harlequin knew that her constant regimen of unconscious training could cease, that the performance they had been relentlessly rehearsing for would never come. 

<!--something here about her slain lover?-->

Gravity told her that down was the direction contra-indicated by her eyes, in the same way that the elation of her freedom from financial and social contracts was sending her signals in defiant contra-indication of her pressing fear about ruin, destitution, starvation and violence.

<!--in editing, I have to try to strip off the fluff, the adjectives that aren't load-bearing-->

Something terrible had happened. As if the crunch of bone and wood in Barcelona had spread out, a tragic circumference of shock bloating first as minor disasters to her troupe--a broken axle, then a leg, then a donkey that had somehow swallowed a bag of spurs--to the scale of the war-gamed map of generals high enough above the battle that a thousand lives were a plume of distant smoke.

Her company was dead, turned, or otherwise destroyed. The only surviving stage machinery that the Baroness had built were the few contraptions left here in Torn with the foppish vintner.

The Harlequin's daughter looked again at the playbook, the script-less arguments, and felt the pull of all those algorithmic engines, like the steam-spewing, boiler-fed devices of extravagant cogs and canvas waterwheels. She turned the book upside down, which was correct from the perspective of the once-opulent room, dark wood crouching under dusty stains and varnish.

Here was the history depicted in the tapestry: The Papal States made several ill-considered concessions to Spanish aggressors, the actual conflict in the northern peninsula a scaled-down proxy for larger military tensions stretched taught across Europe. Huge citadels, war machines of flying vines and steel, scorched terror onto farms and villages, and petty nobles had to choose sides in quickly changing games, the stakes of which were death, or at least the demise of their surplus peasantry and mercenary forces.

Her training, her knowledge, the grudging respect she'd earned from the other comedians, all of it was now as meaningless as coin minted by a foreign power. The great show would never happen. The world in which it was possible had ended. There was nothing left but flight, and terror.

What would it have even meant, the greatest performance ever?

<!-- This draft of the novel should be preoccupied with the dynamics of a society or company, trying to create something beautiful together. -->

It was a preoccupation of both her and her father. For the whole troupe it was the subject of many heated and boozy arguments, lit by greasy candles. While their stage coach, the mud-warped axels turning the wheels against each other, trundled out of some swampy town, they would argue long into the night, then go silent for half a day, and then pick up the thread again as they rolled into the next weed-conquered fairground where they would set up camp and cookfire, ready to tumble, lie, and sing for the next morning's breakfast.

She remembered Jaques, their Scapin, reclining dangerously in the little crow's nest he had tied, patched trousers jouncing with the holes in the road, declaiming, "the greatest performance ever would outshine the ancestors. It would be calling bad luck on ourselves."

"To say nothing of the dreariness of life afterward, knowing there would be nothing left as good" her mother had put in, riding backwards on the Dray, leaning against her father, the brim of his hat shading them both.

"You wouldn't know it was the greatest performance," her famous father had said, the one among them that had risen closest to renown. "Not at the time. Maybe not ever."

The Harlequin kicked her legs over her head, with an acrobatic clip of body weight, spinning on the axis rolling high across her hips, her bare shoulders shrugging off into the air.

From the moment of the kick-flip, the momentum of the thing was set. The next Harlequin had leapt onto the stage.
