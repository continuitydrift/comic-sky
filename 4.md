# 4: Mystery of Pandolfo


<!--

The world was a long time ending. In the meantime, it began again.

"There's nothing special about this case of wine," Pandolfo said, when Spavento caught him dragging it, in one of the hovering wooden chests, slim profile backlit by the weird light under the collapsing vinyard, the otherwise intractable load barely leaving tracks through the dry summer mud.

There was something strange about the way he was speaking. The night before, the deserter from the Spanish army, could have sworn the fake archbishop was from the neighboring Castillian village, had slept and snored in the same mercenary barracks, sang songs around the same fires of spirit wood. Now he sounded like the pompous clergyman he had, at first, pretended to be. 

A similar thing had happened last night, in the middle of a farcical but fascinating about how some apocryphal books about the ascension could support leveler's claims that the savior's floating off into the sky in the gospels was merely a metaphor, and original translations from the Aramaic actually suggested that lifting oneself physically above others made spiritual englightening impossible. The African (after their encounter in the cellars, Pandolfo had revealed his true backstory) took on the mannerisms of his costume, and the tone of playful admiration with which he had been talking about Leveler theology turned abruptly to tones of mockery and contempt, the Castillian dialect losing all music and becoming a parody of itself.

Then, Spavento had noticed the Spanish prisoners lurking under the ruined lintel, and understood the shift. The prisoners still thought the costume was real, that they were the charges of an archbishop of the Holy Roman Church, not some foreign grifter. 

# The Argument

I want new readers to be able to jump in at any point, while I'm serializing these narratives, so the beginning of these sections might have recapitulative redundancies to be ironed out in editing. In the commedia, the brief scriptural outlines pinned to the wings would be preceded by an *argument*, like

> PANDOLFO crashes through the balcony railing with one of the baroness's flying turtles, causing LUCREZIA to cry, remembering her famous father's death. SPAVENTO and PANDOLFO perform the lazzi of maybe-fake fighting. The next morning, battle lines have shifted, and the villa is again under the control of the Spanish crown. PANDOLFO flees, after agreeing to meet SPAVENTO and the others at the ruined stage coach, and playing a trick on his "prisoners".

In this version, that might be left to fill out as backstory. The argument, here and in the commedia, was only meant as an improvisational guide, which can be readily abandoned if the feelings in the room start to shift. 

For now, let's start the scene/chapter with the bishop and the mercenary facing off over a chest full of wine. This wine may or may not cause telepathy, as far as the Spaniard, Spavento knows.

It doesn't. There's nothing special about it, as Pandolfo says. The wine the night before *had* been telepathy inducing, allowing him to read the acrobat and wine-merchants thoughts, or rather hear them, since they had mostly been thinking in music.

In this world, there are flying vinyards, and citadels, and palaces, although many of them are burning and collapsing from the war, and the long period of decadence and inequity leading up to it (the aristocracy and clergy rising far above their subjects, raining fire and damnation).
-->

"My prisoner's were joined early this morning by some Roman dragoons," Pandolfo said, drawing the unloaded firearm from his belt, that they had fought over in the floating root cellars the night before. "The prisoners assumed the papists were under my command, and surrendered themselves."

Part of me wants to have Pandolfo pull out a sword or pistol as a cheap way to heighten focus, but the greater part wants to de-emphasize violence, especially coded as male, and shift conflict or tension to more subtle channels.

<!--the narrator, as the constellated or abstracted algorithm informing the text, can admit to inventing details, while maintaining the fiction that they are describing events that are real to them. They are stealing interdimensional literary forms and publishing them in universes that are pre-convergence, where they seem novel.-->

Pandolfo was thought-deaf, one of the Blessed.

Immunity to the psychic noise blasting from the roots of degravitized trees could be developed by the veterans of aerial combat, but a rare few lacked the part of the brain/mind that allowed for mild telepathic transfer<!--mostly during sleep-->. 


# Pandolfo's Backstory
<!--
I regret starting with the case of wine. For me, it is something I can't know. I have more information about it now, Pandolfo's intentions and the likely level of his veracity, but I want to start with Spavento's point of view, before all the dimensional travel. 
-->

He was born a long time ago, on a flying island of Zanzibar, which Spavento hadn't believed existed until the fake archbishop showed him on a map. Pandolfo had shown unique gifts at both resisting psychic energies from drifted roots, and the uncanny acrobatics of assisted levitation, both of which were necessary to perform extractive harvesting and restorative rootcraft demanded by the looming aristocracy created by the trade routes. <!--Don't feel guilty if you want to imagine un-ecologically sourced flying caravans, complete with circuses and the grim pageantry of forced labor. -->

Gaia, if you believe in something akin to that in your dimension, was taking revenge on the presumptions of industry and empire, forced hordes of zombie-like enslavement. Things already seemed hopeless, the theological and technological progress hopelessly undermining itself, in puppet-like convulsions like the parable of the root-weaver's son. 

The Papal Ascensionists, defending the northern part of the peninsula from the revolutionary Levelers, claimed that the great lifted cathedrals and war machines were incontrovertible testament of G-d's grace, and the destruction of body and mind unleashed against heretics was mere prefiguration of their eternal punishment, separated forever from divine knowledge.

The Leveler's, loyal to the Spanish Queen, but with coffers to rival that of France or the vatican despite their supposed adulation of modesty and poverty, had a down-to-Earth philosophy of reviling idolatrous pretenders who would rise above their flocks, amassing huge mercenary armies and unleashing untold bloodshed in the name of spreading voluntary poverty.

Pandolfo, growing up on a floating island in the Indian ocean East of Africa, the largest in the world, was only aware of the conflict as distant rumors affecting his family's trade routes. 

He traveled too far from home, told too big of lies, and got himself in trouble.

On the other hand, they weren't really lies. He was Blessed. Imagine being one of the few non-telepaths where everyone else was, at some usually sub-surface level, reading each others' minds. 

As he went closer to Iberia, his immunity to root sickness made him into a kind of holy figure, and his uncanny skill with dialects and imitation, combined with the scholarship of his upbringing, gave him opportunities to abuse his client's credulity. Pandolfo took them.

He became, without meaning to, a con man through his honesty, and a religious iconoclast by speaking what he felt to be the unobjectionable truth. He escaped from one predicament into another, increasingly dangerous and intractable, until he was a chaplain on the front lines of the war.

Instead of being captured, in the mangled aftermath of conquest, he would switch sides, able convincingly to play a conscript from either side, having served involuntarily in both aerial armies.

All of this, keep in mind, had been largely conveyed in polyglot pantomime, in between slapstick routines and long, ragged, musical improvisations. It had rained intermittently, the gravitational drifts occasionally throwing sheets of rain up through the torn open wall. 

Pandolfo had left them alone for a moment, and the Spaniard felt a welling nostalgia for the last few nights, the bond the he, Graziano, and Lucrezia had built, now interrupted. It was strange, but somehow the telepathy between the original trio seemed strengthened in the presence of the inscrutable impersonator.

The music, too, was especially sweet. Spavento played an enormous upright bass that lifted him off his feet, letting him float over the pool of dead lilies, filled with damp sheets of music. Maybe it was the telepathic wine, or the thought-retaining instruments, but Spavento thought he had actually seen Lucrezia's voice, spiraling out of her mouth in coruscating colors. The piano too had lifted off of the floor with music, Graziano banging the keys while dancing back to back with the fake archbishop. Pandolfo played the fiddle like he was posessed.

Everything would be destroyed when the villa crashed, or when the revolutionaries or zealots ransacked the final hall. It was a night of terrifying profligacy, all of this doomed, exquisite taste, these millions of hours of craft and labor wiped out by the whims of distant, elevated autocrats. 

<!-- 
It occurs to the writer that quite a few of the small circle of likely readers of this text have played music with him. They can imagine how he would imagine telepathic music would sound.

# The Turtle

Before Pandolfo had left, saying he had to urinate (and ignoring Lucrezia's lewd suggestion he do so off the void-facing portico), they had been discussing what the truest, oldest type of human story was, and the fake arch-bishop had said, "I'll tell you when I get back."

To tell, or remind you, of some things about this world: antigravity exists. It is a natural phenomenon in the evolutionary timeline of the narrative, resulting from a bacteria living mostly in the roots of trees.  

If this were an ordinary novel, I would be afraid of spoilers, but since you are, by giving me feedback, my co-creators, I'll give my games away and tell you that I'm trying to add in scenes and elements that will return, in different forms, on the other side of these character arcs. For instance, the turtle falling through the railings isn't only meant to evoke the death of Lucrezia's father, but also the shattering of the palace window years later at their performance in Versailles. 

<!--Author's note: in our timeline, Louis XIV moved the royal palace to Versailles in 1682. There were some wars around the time between France, Spain, and the holy Roman Empire. This novel is set somewhere around this period, in an alternate dimension with telepathy and floating trees.-->

The scene with Spavento and Pandolfo under the collapsing vinyard, burying the case of wine, casts forward to a scene I'm imagining at the end, where their trick works to well, and the Spanish and Roman soldiers spying on them come back to steal the wine, at the same time the bishop and mercenary return, after the dimensional storms. 

It all has to be compelling **now**, though, before it is finished, as a narrative in itself rather than mere prolepsis, in the same way that this dimension has to be able to stand alone, not just prefigure some inter-dimensional meta-narrative relegating this world, these characters, to sub-real or sub-ordinate status.

<!-- The structure of the series, and the structure of the novels, are also meant to be present in/anticipated by the way I'm structuring this chapter, with different interwoven elements: the wine, the turtle, and the music-->

In the morning, after Spavento left Graziano and Lucrezia snoring in each other's arms, when he was yelling at Pandolfo over the noises of the tree (both *heard* and *known*), the Spaniard thought the bishop would die, crushed between the earth and the floating cellars, or caught up in the dangling vines like the root-weaver's son in the story. He would disappear behind the inverted crags and spore-clouded shelves, or be lifted into the air by up-drafts, only to flip and tumble backward and land on his feet like nothing had happened.

<!--at first I thought I should explain the root-weaver thing, but I like leaving it as an "I'll tell you when I get back"-->


"Why did you tell the prisoners you were an archbishop? Why not tell them you are Spanish, too?" The armored dragoon had asked him the night before, but wanted to hear it again, to see if he was in character. His accent was slipping. 

"I'm not Spanish. My mother is Ottoman. The Pope, the French King, and the Spanish Queen can [profanity?]"

"Why pretend?"

"Our trading blimp was captured after coming up the Red Sea, over Sinai. Before I met the prisoner's I was with a group of Blessed the Holy Romans had sent down to kill and loot survivors. We were hit with ballast from our own side, some dislodged boulders. I woke up days later with a bloodied head and shoulder, and found the stagecoach Lucrezia's troupe had abandoned, with this costume. *They* surrendered to *me*, thinking I could keep them safe." 
<!--to be honest, as much as I'm trying to build symmetry with what I'm imagining now as the end, part of the effect of my style of writing/creation is returning to existing themes and details in a way that hopefully seems planned but is really emergent or improvised (like the commedia actors themselves would do)-->

"What will happen now?"
  <!-- -->

  <!-- -->
"I'll tell you when I see you again," the bishop said.
