# 4: Mystery of Pandolfo

The world took a long time to end. In the meantime, it began again.

"There's nothing special about this case of wine," Pandolfo said, when Spavento caught him dragging it, in one of the hovering wooden chests, slim profile backlit by the weird light under the collapsing vinyard, the otherwise undraggable load barely leaving a track through the dry summer mud.

There was something strange about the way he was speaking. The night before, the conscript, now deserter, of the army of the Holy Earth, could have sworn the fake archbishop was from the same Castillian village, had slept and snored in the same mercenary barracks, sang songs around the same fires of spirit wood.

I want new readers to be able to jump in at any point, while I'm serializing these narratives, so the beginning of these sections might have recapitulative redundancies to be ironed out in editing. In the commedia, the brief scriptural outlines pinned to the wings would be preceded by an *argument*, like

> PANDOLFO crashes through the balcony railing with one of the baroness's flying turtles, causing LUCREZIA to cry, remembering her famous father's death. SPAVENTO and PANDOLFO perform the lazzi of maybe-fake fighting. The next morning, battle lines have shifted, and the villa is again under the control of the Spanish crown. PANDOLFO flees, after agreeing to meet SPAVENTO and the others at the ruined stage coach, and playing a trick on his "prisoners".

In this version, that might be left to fill out as backstory. The argument, here and in the commedia, was only meant as an improvisational guide, which can be readily abandoned if the feelings in the room start to shift. 

For now, let's start the scene/chapter with the bishop and the mercenary facing off over a chest full of wine, which may or may not cause telepathy, as far as the Spaniard, Spavento knows.

It doesn't cause telepathy. There's nothing special about it, as Pandolfo says. In this world, though, telepathic wine exists, as Spavento discovered the night before, having been able to read the acrobat and wine-merchants thoughts, or rather hear them, since they had mostly been thinking in music. There are also flying vinyards, and citadels, and palaces, although many of them are burning and collapsing from the war, and the long period of decadence and inequity leading up to it (the aristocracy and clergy rising far above their subjects, raining fire and damnation).

"My prisoner's were joined early this morning by some Roman dragoons," Pandolfo said, drawing the unloaded firearm from his belt, that they had fought over in the floating root cellars the night before. "The prisoners assumed the papists were under my command, and surrendered themselves."

Part of me wants to have Pandolfo pull out a sword or pistol as a cheap way to heighten focus, but the greater part wants to de-emphasize violence, especially coded as male, and shift conflict or tension to more subtle channels.

<!--the narrator, as the constellated or abstracted algorithm informing the text, can admit to inventing details, while maintaining the fiction that they are describing events that are real to them. They are stealing interdimensional literary forms and publishing them in universes that are pre-convergence, where they seem novel.-->

Pandolfo was thought-deaf, one of the Blessed.

Immunity to the psychic noise blasting from the roots of degravitized trees could be developed by the veterans of aerial combat, but a rare few lacked the part of the brain/mind that allowed for mild telepathic transfer<!--mostly during sleep-->. 


# Pandolfo's Backstory
<!--
I regret starting with the case of wine. For me, it is something I can't know. I have more information about it now, Pandolfo's intentions and the likely level of his veracity, but I want to start with Spavento's point of view, before all the dimensional travel. 
-->

He was born a long time ago, on a flying island of Zanzibar, which Spavento hadn't believed existed until the fake archbishop showed him on a map. Known as Techlis, Pandolfo had shown unique gifts at both resisting psychic energies from drifted roots, and the uncanny acrobatics of assisted levitation, both of which were necessary to perform extractive harvesting and restorative rootcraft demanded by the looming aristocracy created by the trade routes. Don't feel guilty if you want to imagine un-ecologically sourced flying caravans, complete with circuses and the grim pageantry of mostly-slaves. 

Gaia, if you believe in something akin to that in your dimension, was taking revenge on the presumptions of industry and empire, forced hordes of zombie-like enslavement. Things already seemed hopeless, the theological and technological progress hopelessly undermining itself, in puppet-like convulsions like the parable of the root-weaver's son. 

The Papal Ascensionists, defending the northern part of the peninsula from the revolutionary Levelers, claimed that the great lifted cathedrals and war machines were incontrovertible testament of G-d's grace, and the destruction of body and mind unleashed against heretics was mere prefiguration of their eternal punishment, separated forever from divine knowledge.

The Leveler's, loyal to the Spanish Queen, but with coffers to rival that of France or the vatican despite their supposed adulation of modesty and poverty, had a down-to-Earth philosophy of reviling idolatrous pretenders who would rise above their flocks, amassing huge mercenary armies and unleashing untold bloodshed in the name of spreading voluntary poverty.

Pandolfo, growing up on a floating island in the Indian ocean East of Africa, the largest in the world, was only aware of the conflict as distant rumors affecting his family's trade routes. 

He traveled too far from home, told too big of lies, and got himself in trouble.

On the other hand, they weren't really lies. He was Blessed. Imagine being one of the few non-telepaths where everyone else was, at some usually sub-surface level, reading each others' minds. 

As he went closer to Iberia, his immunity to root sickness made him into a kind of holy figure, and his uncanny skill with dialects and imitation, combined with the scholarship of his upbringing, gave him opportunities to abuse his client's credulity. Pandolfo took them.

He became, without meaning to, a con man through his honesty, and a religious iconoclast by speaking what he felt to be the unobjectionable truth. He escaped from one predicament into another, increasingly dangerous and intractable, until he was a chaplain on the front lines of the war.

Instead of being captured, in the mangled aftermath of conquest, he would switch sides, able convincingly to play a conscript from either side, having served involuntarily in both aerial armies.

All of this, keep in mind, had been largely conveyed in polyglot pantomime, in between slapstick routines and long, ragged, musical improvisations.




Pandolfo had left them alone for a moment, and the Spaniard felt a welling nostalgia for the last few nights, the bond the he, Graziano, and Lucrezia had built, now interrupted. It was strange, but somehow the telepathy between the original trio seemed strengthened in the presence of the inscrutable impersonator.

The music, too, was especially sweet. 



Before Pandolfo had left, saying he had to urinate (and ignoring Lucrezia's lewd suggestion he do so off the void-facing portico), they had been discussing what the truest, oldest type of human story was, and the fake arch-bishop had said, "I'll tell you when I get back."

To tell, or remind you, of some things about this world: antigravity exists. It is a natural phenomenon in the evolutionary timeline of the narrative, resulting from a bacteria living mostly in the roots of trees.
