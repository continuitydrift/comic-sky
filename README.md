This is more like a game than a novel, designed to have elements of both.

The seed of the project is replicable as another one-player game.

I'm releasing it more like software because

- My desire to collaborate openly is greater than my desire to profit by selling the things I write, especially to my friends.

- Releasing everything in a public repository will keep my work safe from plagiarism or unfair use, since there will be a transparent, accessible record of the process.

<!-- I can even protect my current work from future, foolish versions of myself that might have worse taste -->

- The chapters will be published on [Spindle](https://www.spindle-asa.com/), updating every full moon. Hosting them here as well will allow easy version control among different editors and commenters.
