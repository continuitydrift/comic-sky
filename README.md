# Comic Sky

This is more like a game than a novel, designed to have elements of both.

Anyone can play any of the characters, and by "play" I mean influence the story of. Readers or listeners can also suggest changes regarding theme, setting, plot, or language.

<!--This file, too, the practice and process of creating it, can reflect the project as a whole, in that it is
	- iterative
	- self aware
	- multilayered
-->

It's like a role playing game in that I want to write and share this version of it serially, so that feedback can be incorporated real-time.

This novel, unlike role-playing games, as I usually understand them, will also loop back to edit, and possibly significantly change, previous chapters.

Also I, as the author (different from the narrative "I" of the novel pages) will, unlike in games, tell you everything up front, my current plans for the entire series, similarly subject to revision and change.

<!-- 
The seed of the project is replicable as another one-player game.

I'm releasing it more like software because

- My desire to collaborate openly is greater than my desire to profit by selling the things I write, especially to my friends.

- Releasing everything in a public repository will keep my work safe from plagiarism or unfair use, since there will be a transparent, accessible record of the process.

<!-- I can even protect my current work from future, foolish versions of myself that might have worse taste -->

- The chapters will be published on [Spindle](https://www.spindle-asa.com/), updating every full moon. Hosting them here as well will allow easy version control among different editors and commenters.
