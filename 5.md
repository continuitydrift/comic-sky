5: The Stagecoach

<!--argument: They had fled to the broken stage coach, possibly pursued by the Spanish prisoners. When they got there, they encountered a group of mercenaries. Spavento and Pandolfo convince them that Graziano and Lucrezia were their prisoners. However, they are coming back with a Captain. 

Lucrezia tells them to move the heavy debris off the stage coach, and it lifts them into the air.-->

"What are you doing?" Lucrezia demanded of Spavento, who had picked up a shovel and started digging, prying up a few loose stones and scooping out dry shovel fulls of dirt. 

"I'm digging a hole," he answered. He could feel the acrobat staring at him, but said no more. 

A breeze cooled the sweat sticking his clothes to his shoulders like the shell of some overheating insect. The sky loomed impossibly large and bright. It would be a good spot to die, Spavento thought.

you know, for all that I say I will go back and drastically edit the things that I write, usually the first drafts stand.

There's a bright sunbeam coming through the window (south west?)

A scraggly grove of oaks hugged their shadows close in the midday sun. The stones warm on the sole of his left boot where the sole had worn through, a dull sting where some burr or leaf blade had managed to cut through the callus. The air smelled of sage and cedar.<!--I could look up some more climate-appropriate flora, but it's an alternate dimension anyway, right?-->

As much as Lucrezia exasperated him, in the clarity of his felt mortality, he saw that she was beautiful, in ways that his provincial boyhood lusts hadn't trained him to appreciate. 

Graziano, admittedly, also had a kind of grace, a hint of the higher culture that the oligarchy promised, but which the dragoon himself had never witnessed. All the aristocracy ever revealed to him directly was an indifferent, almost cruel brutality, as if the beauty of their architecture and paintings had been taken from their soul as balance.

From the moment he'd drunkenly attacked the wine merchant's son in the cellars, he and the acrobat had assumed the best of his intentions, even when he'd been unsure of them himself.

That wine. Or the instruments. Or something else, being near the root systems of the falling vinyards, had changed him. He'd been ready to die since he was conscripted, but didn't expect have his soul destroyed and replaced with some kind of unrecognizable patchwork.

"Why?" Lucrezia finally demanded, as Pandolfo went to fill their water bladders, jars, and bottles from the stream.

Was the telepathic wine really in the crate they had floated here with them? Or was it in the almost identical chest that Pandolfo had buried in the vinyards, supposedly as a ruse. No, he had tasted it. The trick was against the Spanish prisoners, not them. 

Spavento was realizing with a mounting terror that he had been in a drunken telepathic haze since he had fallen from the ziggaurat. He didn't feel sure of who he was, but he wanted those around him to survive. Which thoughts were his? What were they planning to do? He needed to think.

<!--what next?--> While the morning swept away mists, the four of them had moved across a dry landscape striated with war and geology. Gravitic debri floated slowly down from where the battles had been the day before. Heaps of cloth and metal on the slabs of stones might have been corpses.

They had tried to sneak out of the villa without seeming like they were trying to sneak out, but apparently not all of the Spaniards had been distracted by Pandolfo's supposed buried treasure. Four had followed them as far as town. 

Graziano, at the crossroads, had tried to insist that they buy donkeys and horses, then go back to the villa to grab more of his possessions. Spavento had felt contempt for his weakness, the way his eyes teared up and his voice broke.

"At least one of the paintings," he had pleaded. "Or the tapestry. Surely we can take more with us than a single crate of wine."

"That wine is worth more than everything else altogether," Pandolfo said, looking past the foppish vinter to the horizon. "Besides, the villa is burning."

It was. A plume of smoke curled upwards like a lock of dark hair. Graziano had started sobbing, dropping to his knees in the road, getting filth on his expensive silks. Spavento had watched, fascinated, as Lucrezia had bent towards him, slapped him across the cheek, and kissed him.

"Let's go," she had said.

They hadn't been sure if the Leveler soldiers were following them as they followed shepherds paths along the deep mountain river valley, which wagged back and forth around ledges, thankfully without much ascent or descent, save for a few treacherous passes where they had to grab one another's hands.
