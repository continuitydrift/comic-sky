<!--argument: They had fled to the broken stage coach, possibly pursued by the Spanish prisoners. When they got there, they encountered a group of mercenaries. Spavento and Pandolfo convince them that Graziano and Lucrezia were their prisoners. However, they are coming back with a Captain.

A scraggly grove of oaks, hugging their shadows close in the midday sun. The stones warm on the sole of his left boot where the sole had worn through, a dull sting where some burr or leaf blade had managed to cut through the callus. The air smelled of sage and cedar.<!--I could look up some more climate-appropriate flora, but it's an alternate dimension anyway, right?-->
